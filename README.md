# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
I explored how to analyze and classify emotions from speech using deep learning techniques. 
By applying audio features and advanced algorithms, I aimed to enhance human-machine interaction and provide deeper insights into emotional nuances.

**Key takeaways from the project:**
- Data Preprocessing: Learned the importance of cleaning and     
  preparing audio data for analysis.
- Modeling: Implemented LSTM, optimizing for 
  accuracy in emotion classification.
- Insights: Discovered how context and tone can dramatically  
  impact emotion recognition.
